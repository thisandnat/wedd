# Welcome to our wedding!

We’re happy to invite you to celebrate with us on the first of July 2023. 

The event will take place at **Lyran** at 17:00 with a welcome drink and ceremony outside, followed by dinner and festivities inside.

### Dress code:

Summery and relaxed - no strict dress code, just wear something nice. 

The ceremony will be held outside, so be aware that pleasant temperatures and clear skies cannot be guaranteed.

### Location:

Konditori Lyran, Ålgrytevägen 90, 127 32 Skärholmen

### Gifts:

We know many of our guests are travelling far (and we live in a small flat) so we don’t expect any gifts. 
However, if you want to support the party and our honeymoon, that would be greatly appreciated, as would a charity donation. 
We will be making a donation to [Axel’s father’s memorial fund](https://www.cancerfonden.se/insamlingar/anders-hulterstroms-minne) at Cancerfonden.
