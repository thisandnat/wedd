## About Stockholm and where to stay

The city of Stockholm is approximately 800 years old and has an intricate layout of islands and many beautiful sights.

There are no hotels around the wedding venue, but it's only half an hour from the city centre. We recommend finding a hotel in the city centre, close to a metro stop.
